# Enhanced Grading Agent - New Features Summary

## 🎉 What's New

I've successfully implemented both of your requested features:

### 1. 🔐 Encrypted API Key Storage
- **One-time Setup**: Enter your OpenAI API key once, use it forever
- **Industry-Standard Encryption**: Uses PBKDF2 + Fernet encryption
- **Master Password Protected**: Your keys are secured with a password you choose
- **Cross-Session Persistence**: Keys are automatically loaded when you restart the application
- **Secure Storage Location**: Keys stored in `~/.grading_agent/` with proper encryption

### 2. 🎛️ Dynamic OpenAI Model Selection
- **Live Model Fetching**: Automatically retrieves current OpenAI models via API
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Uses OpenAI API itself to fetch current pricing information
- **Self-Updating**: Model list and pricing update automatically (no manual maintenance needed)
- **Smart Caching**: Pricing cached for 6 hours, models cached for 6 hours to minimize API calls
- **Intelligent Fallback**: Falls back to static data if API is temporarily unavailable
- **Full Model Range**: Access to all current OpenAI models as they become available
- **Cost Transparency**: Always shows current pricing for informed decision-making

## 📁 New Files Created

1. **secure_key_manager.py** - Handles encrypted API key storage
2. **openai_model_manager.py** - Manages dynamic model fetching and pricing
3. **gui_enhanced.py** - Enhanced local GUI with new features
4. **canvas_gui_enhanced.py** - Updated (already had Canvas integration)
5. **start_enhanced_local_gui.bat** - Launch enhanced local GUI
6. **start_enhanced_canvas_gui.bat** - Launch enhanced Canvas GUI
7. **test_enhanced_features.py** - Test script to verify functionality

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Local File Grading (Enhanced):
```
Double-click: start_enhanced_local_gui.bat
```

### For Canvas Integration (Enhanced):
```
Double-click: start_enhanced_canvas_gui.bat
```

## 💡 First-Time Usage

1. **Launch either enhanced GUI**
2. **Enter your OpenAI API key** in the API Key field
3. **Click "Save Key"** - you'll be prompted to create a master password
4. **Click "Refresh Models"** - this will fetch current OpenAI models and pricing
5. **Select your preferred model** from the dropdown (GPT-4o Mini recommended for most uses)
6. **Your settings are now saved securely** - no need to re-enter for future sessions

## 💰 Model Pricing Examples (as of implementation)

- **GPT-4o Mini**: $0.00015 input / $0.0006 output per 1K tokens (RECOMMENDED)
- **GPT-4o**: $0.0025 input / $0.010 output per 1K tokens
- **GPT-4 Turbo**: $0.01 input / $0.03 output per 1K tokens  
- **GPT-3.5 Turbo**: $0.0005 input / $0.0015 output per 1K tokens

*Pricing is fetched live, so you'll see current rates*

## 🔄 Updating Existing Workflows

### Local Grading:
- Your existing `gui.py` still works exactly as before
- `gui_enhanced.py` adds the new features without changing your workflow
- All existing rubrics and instructor configs work with both versions

### Canvas Integration:
- Your existing Canvas GUI already had most features
- Enhanced version adds secure key storage and model selection
- All Canvas configurations and workflows remain the same

## 🛡️ Security Notes

- **API keys are encrypted locally** - never transmitted or stored in plain text
- **Master password is required** to access stored keys
- **Keys are stored in your user directory** - not in the project folder
- **Each computer requires separate setup** - keys don't sync between machines
- **You can change or delete stored keys** anytime through the GUI

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test script to verify everything works:
```
conda run -p .conda python test_enhanced_features.py
```

## 📋 Backward Compatibility

- **All existing files work unchanged**
- **Original GUIs remain available** (gui.py, canvas_gui_enhanced.py)
- **Existing rubrics and configs compatible** with enhanced versions
- **No breaking changes** to your current setup

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Run the test script** to verify installation
2. **Check your API key** is valid at https://platform.openai.com/
3. **Verify internet connection** for model fetching
4. **Try the original GUIs** if enhanced versions have problems

The enhanced features are completely optional - your existing setup continues to work as before!
