## Output Format

The system generates a spreadsheet with the following columns:

### Student Information
- `Student_Name`: Student's name (never sent to AI)
- `Canvas_User_ID`: unique Canvas identifier
- `AI_Score`: Total points earned
- `Max_Score`: Maximum possible points
- `Percentage`: Score as percentage
- `Final_Grade`: Final score that will be passed back to Canvas
- `Grading_Date`: When grading was completed

### Feedback
- `AI_Comments`: Comprehensive overall and individual criterion feedback, will provide each criterion score
- `Final_Comments`: Feedback that will be passed back to Canvas

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**API Key Errors**
- Ensure your OpenAI API key is valid and has sufficient credits
- Check for extra spaces or characters in the key

**File Loading Errors**
- Verify file formats are supported
- Ensure files are not corrupted or password-protected
- Check file permissions

**Grading Errors**
- Verify rubric JSON syntax is valid (or tell the application to download the assignment rubric from Canvas)
- Ensure papers contain sufficient text content
- Check internet connection for API calls 

### Log Files
Check `grading_log.txt` for detailed error messages and processing information.

## Best Practices

### For Better Grading Results:
1. **Clear Rubrics**: Write detailed, specific rubric criteria
2. **Instructor Configuration**: Create an instructor configuration file that closely matches your style, beliefs, and philosophy; then test grade with the configuration to ensure grading validity
3. **Quality Papers**: Ensure student papers are well-formatted and readable (recommend .docx for papers/reports and tabular formats for data)
4. **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent filename conventions for students
5. **Review Results**: Always review AI-generated grades before finalizing
6. **Backup Data**: Keep backups of original papers and rubrics

### Cost Management:
- Use gpt mini models for (much) lower costs (may impact quality, but this is usually imperceptable)
- Have students submit .docx (Microsoft Word) files for papers/reports and tabular formats (.xlsx, .csv) for data
- Be targeted in course material uploads (e.g., relevant chapters instead of the full textbook)
- Set a reasonable budget
