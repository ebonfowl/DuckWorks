# Password Dialog Hanging Issue - FIX COMPLETE ✅

## Problem Description
When trying to save the API key in the local GUI, the program would hang (not responding) because the `getpass.getpass()` function was being called in the GUI thread, which blocks the GUI while waiting for console input that never comes.

## Root Cause
The `SecureKeyManager` class was using `getpass.getpass()` to prompt for passwords in a console environment, but when called from a GUI application, this blocks the GUI thread indefinitely because there's no console for user input.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Password Callback Support
Modified the `SecureKeyManager` class to support optional password callback functions:
- `_get_master_password()` now accepts an optional `password_callback` parameter
- `save_config()` and `load_config()` methods now support password callbacks
- `get_config_value()` method updated to pass through password callbacks

### 2. Created Custom Password Dialog
Added a `PasswordDialog` class to both GUI applications:
- Professional-looking password input dialog with proper validation
- Supports both "create" and "unlock" modes
- Handles password confirmation for new passwords
- Enforces minimum password length requirements
- Proper focus management and keyboard shortcuts

### 3. Updated GUI Applications
Both `gui_enhanced.py` and `canvas_gui_enhanced.py` now:
- Include the `PasswordDialog` class
- Have a `password_callback()` method that creates and manages the dialog
- Pass the password callback to all key manager operations
- Provide a seamless user experience without hanging

### 4. Updated APIKeyManager Methods
All credential management methods now support password callbacks:
- `save_openai_key()`
- `get_openai_key()`
- `save_canvas_credentials()`
- `get_canvas_credentials()`
- `clear_openai_key()`
- `clear_canvas_credentials()`

## Files Modified
1. `secure_key_manager.py` - Added password callback support throughout
2. `gui_enhanced.py` - Added PasswordDialog and password callback method
3. `canvas_gui_enhanced.py` - Added PasswordDialog and password callback method

## Testing Results
- ✅ Password dialog creation works without hanging
- ✅ API key saving/loading works with GUI password prompts
- ✅ Canvas credentials saving/loading works with GUI password prompts
- ✅ All operations complete successfully without blocking the GUI thread
- ✅ Fallback to console input still works for command-line usage

## User Experience Improvements
- **No more hanging**: GUI remains responsive during password operations
- **Professional dialogs**: Clean, user-friendly password input dialogs
- **Visual feedback**: Clear instructions and error messages
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Enter to confirm, Escape to cancel
- **Password validation**: Enforced security requirements with clear messaging

The issue has been completely resolved. Users can now save and load API keys through the GUI without any hanging or blocking issues.
